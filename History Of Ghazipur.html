        <h2><P>The word Ghazipur does not figure as such in ancient Indian History, but according to some historians Raja Ghadhi father of Maharsi Jamdagni was from this place. During that period this place was covered with dense forests and in it many Ashrams were situated viz. Yamdagni (father of Parasuram) 
            Ashram, Parsuram Ashram, Madan Van etc. The Maharshi Gautam’s Ashram was near Ghazipur town some 16 Kms. east around the village Gauspur. Sarnath, where Lord Buddha got Bodhisatva or enlightenment in 6th century B.C is about 65 km. west from this district headquarter & falls in Varanasi district. 
            Thus it became a center of Budha’s preachings during his time.This town was an important centre during Buddhist period. The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang mentions this locality as “Chanchu” meaning the soil of battlefields which is signified by many important battles fought here.</P></h2>
